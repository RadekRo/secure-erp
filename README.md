# secure-erp

## Project created due to CodeCool IT course requirements
## Language: PYTHON (100%)

Complete file/catalogue structure is provided by the excersise. All functions except those in data_manager.py are created from scratch.
The main idea is to not use any `import` in the whole project. Except util.py file where the both imports: `string` and `random` were allready provided by the supervisors.
